# GoGoG Project Notes

Date: March 20, 2025

## Project Progress

The GoGoG (Go, Go, Go!) project has been initiated with the goal of creating an interactive, web-based platform for learning the Go programming language through gamification and 3D visualizations. Current progress includes:

- Basic project structure for both frontend and backend
- Frontend UI components setup with React and TailwindCSS
- Three.js visualization engine integration
- Code editor with Go syntax highlighting
- Backend API structure with Gin framework
- Database schema design
- Authentication system with JWT

## Development Process

### Frontend Development

```bash
# Start the frontend development server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend Development

```bash
# Run the backend server
cd backend
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Create a PostgreSQL database
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE gogog;"

# Apply the database schema
psql -d gogog -f backend/internal/db/schema.sql
```

## Next Steps

1. **WebAssembly Integration**
   - Implement the Go WebAssembly execution environment
   - Create the communication layer between frontend and WebAssembly
   - Secure the code execution sandbox

2. **3D Visualizations**
   - Develop visualizations for Go data structures (arrays, slices, maps)
   - Create animations for concurrency concepts (goroutines, channels)
   - Build interactive visualization controls

3. **Content Management System**
   - Complete the backend content APIs
   - Create a module/challenge management interface
   - Implement content versioning

4. **User Progression System**
   - Complete the user progress tracking
   - Implement the achievement and reward system
   - Create the leaderboard functionality

5. **Game Narrative Integration**
   - Implement the "Go Treasure Islands" storyline
   - Design island visualizations for each learning module
   - Create character animations and interactions

## Testing

### Frontend Testing

```bash
# Run frontend tests
cd frontend
npm run test
```

Frontend tests should cover:
- Component rendering
- State management
- Visualization engine functionality
- Code editor and execution
- User interactions

### Backend Testing

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend
go test ./...
```

Backend tests should cover:
- API endpoint functionality
- Authentication and authorization
- Database operations
- Content management
- User progression tracking

### End-to-End Testing

Future implementation will include Cypress for end-to-end testing of user flows.

## Performance Considerations

- Monitor and optimize Three.js rendering performance
- Ensure efficient memory management for WebAssembly execution
- Implement proper caching strategies for content delivery
- Consider progressive loading for larger visualizations

## Security Notes

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Secure the WebAssembly execution environment
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
